# WP-Twenty-Nineteen-Child
A base child theme for twenty-nineteen using Grunt to allow SASS and Min-JS

I haven't used Wordpress in about a year ( except for basic updates of existing websites ) and so I wanted to kind-of touch base
on some things including theme development, plugin development, etc...

It's always good to keep things fresh.

This very basic child theme for Twenty-Ninteen uses Grunt to compile SASS and Javascript.

It's so basic, it really could be used as a child-template for any existing theme. 

To compile the scripts you will need Node.js and Ruby installed.

Once installed simply type grunt in the root of the theme.
